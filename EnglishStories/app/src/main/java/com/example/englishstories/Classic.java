    String story[]={"Once a farmer lost his precious watch while working in his barn. It may have appeared as an ordinary watch to others, but held a deep sentimental value for it. After searching high and low among the hay for a long time, the old farmer got exhausted. The tired farmer did not want to give up the search for his watch and requested a group of children playing outside the barn to help. He promised an attractive reward for the person who can find his beloved watch. After hearing about the reward, the children hurried inside the barn and went through and round the entire stack of hay to find the watch. After a long time looking for a watch in the hay, some of the children got tired and gave up. The number of children looking for the watch slowly decreased and only few tired children were left. The farmer gave up all his hope to find the watch and called off the search. Just when the farmer was closing the door, a little boy came up to him and requested the farmer to give him another chance. The farmer did not want to miss any chance of finding the watch so let the little boy in the barn. After a w little while the little boy came out with the watch in his hand. The farmer was happily surprised and asked how the boy succeeded to get the watch while everyone including him  had failed. The boy replied “ I just sat there tried listening to the ticking of the watch. In silence, it was much easier to listen to it and direct the search in the direction of the sound.” The farmer was delighted to get the watch and rewarded the little boy as promised.", "SO little Bridget took the baby on her right arm and a jug in her left hand, and went to the farm to get the milk. On her way she went by the garden-gate of a large house that stood close to the farm, and she told the baby a story:“Last summer, she said,” a little girl, bigger than you, for she was just able to walk, came to stay in that house she and her father and mother. All about the road just here, the ducks and the chickens from the farm, and an old turkey, used to walk about all the day long, but the poor little ducks were very unhappy, for they had no pond to swim about in, only that narrow ditch through which the streamlet is flowing. When the little girl's father saw this, he took a spade, and worked and worked very hard, and out of the ditch and the streamlet he made a little pond for the ducks, and they swam about and were very happy all through the summer days. Every morning I used to stand and watch, and presently the garden-gate would open, and then the father would come out, leading the little girl by the hand, and the mother brought a large plateful of bits of broken bread. The little girl used to throw the bread to the ducks, and they ran after it and ate it up quickly, while she laughed out with glee,, and the father and the mother laughed too just as merrily. Baby, the father had blue eyes, and a voice that you seemed to hear with your heart. “The little girl used to feed the chickens too, and the foolish old turkey that was so fond of her it would run after her until she screamed and was afraid. The dear father and the little girl came out every morning, while the black pigs looked through the bars of the farm-yard gate and grunted at them, as if they were glad, and I think the ducks knew that the father had made the pond, for they swam round and round it proudly while he watched them, but when he went away they seemed tired and sad. “The pond is not there now, baby, for a man came by one day and made it into a ditch again; and the chickens and the ducks from the farm are kept in another place. “The little girl is far away in her own home, which the father made for her, and the dear father lives in his own home too in the hearts of those he loved. That was the story that Bridget told the baby.", "IT was the most tiresome kite in the world, always wagging its tail, shaking its ears, breaking its string, sitting down on the tops of houses, getting stuck in trees, entangled in hedges, flopping down on ponds, or lying flat on the grass, and refusing to rise higher than a yard from the ground. I have often sat and thought about that kite, and wondered who its father and mother were. Perhaps they were very poor people, just made of newspaper and little bits of common string knotted together, obliged to fly day and night for a living, and never able to give any time to their children or to bring them up properly. It was pretty, for it had a snow-white face, and pink and white ears ; and, with these, no one, let alone a kite, could help being pretty. But though the kite was pretty, it was not good, and it did not prosper; it came to a bad end, oh! a terrible end indeed. It stuck itself on a roof one day, a common red roof with a broken chimney and three tiles missing. It stuck itself there, and it would not move; the children tugged and pulled and coaxed and cried, but still it would not move. At last they fetched a ladder, and had nearly reached it when suddenly the kite started and flew away right away over the field and over the heath, and over the far far woods, and it never came back again-never -never. Dear, that is all. But I think sometimes that perhaps beyond the dark pines and the roaring sea the kite is flying still, on and on, farther and farther away, for ever and for ever.", "Hugo arranged his old coat properly and was waiting and listening to the claps and noise that the spectators were making while his master James Douglas was addressing them. As he waited besides the curtains at one side of the stage he heard his master say now my associate Mr. Hugo will shoot me with a gun while I will try to catch the bullet in my mouth. Hugo came in front of the audience and they all clapped. He had heard them clap before a thousand times, but all the glory all the fame was not for him to keep but his master the great magician James Douglas. Douglas announced anyone to come forward to check the genuinity of the gun. One man came on the stage he checked the gun, the iron ball which was to be the bullet and even the gun powder. Hugo looked at the man impatiently; as he has seen hundreds of them checking the instruments before and none had ever found anything wrong for there was no trickery in the tools. It was the place where the bullet in the barrel was kept that mattered. These guns were used earlier by people but now they only existed in museums and with magicians doing the bullet catch stunt. The powder was loaded into the pistol but the bullet that the people expected to be thrashed deep inside the barrel of the gun was just kept on the outer brim of the barrel. The little alteration made the bullet eject slowly, enough for any person to catch it but the audience couldn’t notice the change. Hugo adjusted the bullet on the brim and aimed it right at the great magician. Hugo had been working for him for the last 20 years .he had come as a boy and agreed to work for Douglas hoping to become a great magician himself, and he could become one if Douglas was dead, for he knew all the tricks all the stunts that Douglas knew and even better but with Douglas alive he could not dare to start his own show. only if he would die then the stage would be Hugo’s the men working for Douglas would be his for Douglas had no family. The audience was silent and all were staring at the two. Hugo remembered how he escorted Douglas everywhere anywhere, but he was never appreciated more and never had Douglas given Hugo a chance to perform himself on the stage, only if he would die today thought Hugo the coming days would be his. He looked straight into Douglas bright excited eyes. In the coming years his eyes would also look as excited though Hugo whose eyes right then seemed to burn with rage. He quickly his put finger in front of the barrel and pushed the bullet deep inside. The audience didn’t notice Douglas did but before he could do anything the bullet had blown his brains. Hugo screamed, the audience screamed the doctor came rushing and declared him dead. Hugo was crying in front of the crowd but deep inside he was just happy. The newspaper termed it as an accident. Now the stage was Hugo’s, the audience was Hugo’s. 20 years later the same newspaper wrote;’ the great magician Hugo died accidentally in a stunt called as ‘catching the bullet’. The bullet that his 20 year old associate shot at him blew his brains out while he was trying to catch it with his mouth.", };
